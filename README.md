## I need new Extensiv credentials

All users should have received a welcome email from Extensiv that includes a temporary password and link to sign into the new Extensiv Hub. The message may have been flagged as spam/junk and removed from your inbox. If you can not find the original email address, GWSI can request a new message on your behalf.

[Contact GWSI support](mailto:support@mgearceinc.com?subject=Extensiv%20invitation%20request) to request a new invitation message with a temporary password. In your email message, please be sure to provide the following information we need to verify your account:

## I have Extensiv credentials, but I forget my old 3PL Central credentials

After signing in with your new Extensiv credentials, you may be prompted to sign in again using your old 3PL Central login information. If you don't have your 3PL Central username and/or password, GWSI can request an account update on your behalf. The process will be the same as if your are requesting new Extensiv credentials.

## I signed in, but still can't access the Extensiv Hub WMS

Some users are experiencing issues accessing the Warehouse Manager after signing in with their new Extensiv Hub credentials. The most common issue is another sign in form requesting a _TPL Guid_.
